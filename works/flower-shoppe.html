          <h5>The Product</h5>
          <p>
            Flower Shoppe is regional flower purchasing and delivery app,
            striving to create a personal experience for users, as well as
            having various settings to improve accessibility for users and the
            inclusivity of the app.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-end">Project Duration</h5>
          <p class="text-end">September 2023 - October 2023</p>
          <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <p>Users lack time to personally select and deliver flowers.</p>
          <h5 class="text-end">The Goal</h5>
          <p class="text-end">
            Design an app that allows users to order and deliver personalised
            flower bouquets.
          </p>
          <h5>My Role</h5>
          <p>
            Lead UX Designer and UX Researcher designing an app for Flower
            Shoppe from concept to delivery.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-end">My Responsibilities</h5>
          <p class="text-end">
            Conducting user research, designing paper and digital wireframes,
            creating low and high fidelity prototypes, conducting interviews and
            usability studies, developing mockups, accounting for accessibility
            and iterating on designs.

          <h3>Understanding the user</h3>
          <h5>User Research: Summary</h5>
          <p>
            In order to gain an understanding on prospective customers, I
            conducted interviews and developed empathy maps to group together
            common pain points between users. A main user group found were busy
            adults that don’t have time to personally go and select flowers,
            especially within working hours. <br /><br />This confirmed earlier
            assumptions that users often don’t have enough time in their
            schedules to choose flowers. It also revealed that users often don’t
            have time to personally deliver flowers either. I also found that
            users were unsure on what flowers to gift and often felt overwhelmed
            by the large selection of flower options.
          </p>

              <h6>Time</h6>
              Users often don’t have enough time to personally go and select
              flowers, or to make it to the florist during opening hours.

              <h6>Loyalty</h6>
              There are not many flower delivery companies which provide loyalty
              services to customers, allowing them to personalise their
              experiences.

              <h6>Accessibility</h6>
              Flower delivery sites are often non-accessible to people with
              impairments and who don’t speak English.

              <h6>App</h6>
              Currently there is no app for any flower delivery service, all
              must be purchased through websites, making it hard to access,
              especially for returning customers.

                Overall there is no mobile app for flower delivery services, so
                overall having a mobile application is beneficial to the user.
                The home screen also personalizes the experience for the user as
                most companies in the industry don’t provide a sign-up service.

            required to complete tasks and answer questions.

          <p>Round 1 Findings:</p>

          <h5>Mockups</h5>
          <h6>Homepage</h6>
          <p>
            Early designs showed the blog at the top of the home page, with the
            ‘Catalogue’ and ‘Build A Bouquet’ buttons further down. These key
            buttons were moved to the top of the page, with the ‘Catalogue’
            button being made larger with a bigger font so customers will see
            this button first.

            Originally the bouquet page was small with one picture, and you
            didn’t have to scroll. The page was made longer with more images and
            a ratings bar at the top as well as an ‘Add To Favourites button’
            down the bottom. Furthermore the top and bottom menu and title bars
            were made to be kept on the top and bottom of the screen
            respectively while scrolling for easy access.

              An ‘Accessibility’ page was included for users to be able to set
              their desired font size, contrast, brightness, sound and
              vibration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">2</h6>

              The colours chosen for text have been tested and pass the WCAG AA
              standards, furthermore all key buttons have a black outline on the
              white background to enhance visibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">3</h6>

              Icons as well as their respective texts have been included
              throughout to indicate the actions for certain buttons or to what
              page they will navigate to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">4</h6>

              The top and bottom bars were designed so they remained at the top
              and bottom of the screen respectively, allowing users easy access
              to the menu, cart, user page and back buttons.

          <h5>Takeaways</h5>
          <h6>Impact</h6>
          <p>
            The app allows personalisations for users and allows them to quickly
            complete orders with saved information, as well as being accessible.
            “I really like all the information you can save in your account, it
            makes it really easy to re-order flowers.” - Usability study
            participant
          </p>
          <h6>What I Learned</h6>
          <p>
            I learned that it’s highly important to think about accessibility
            throughout the whole process, to ensure all users have equitable
            access to the app and different features it provides. If
            accessibility isn’t considered, the app then becomes unusable for a
            portion of the population.

          THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO REVIEW MY CASE STUDY FOR ‘FLOWER
          SHOPPE’. THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT I HAVE COMPLETED TOWARDS ACHIEVING
          MY UX DESIGN CERTIFICATE, AND IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE LEARNT ABOUT
          ANY UX DESIGN CONCEPTS AS WELL AS USING FIGMA FOR THE FIRST TIME. I
          WOULD LIKE TO DISCLAIM THAT THIS IS NOT A REAL APP, COMPANY OR
          WEBSITE. PHOTOS AND ICONS USED WITHIN THE PROTOTYPES ARE NOT MY OWN
          AND HAVE BEEN USED ONLY FOR THE CASE OF THIS PROJECT.
