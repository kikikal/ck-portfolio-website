          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <h6>The Product</h6>
          <p>
            ‘HealthEat’ is a responsive website and mobile application that
            allows users to meal plan and also order ingredients in advance to
            save time and money while also being healthier and more sustainable.
          </p>
          <h6>Project Duration</h6>

          <h6>The Problem</h6>
          <p>
            Young adults find it difficult to organise meals in advance, and
            also find time to shop for ingredients while being money and health
            concious.
          </p>
          <h6>The Goal</h6>
          <p>
            Design a cross platform tool to help young adults learn how to cook
            healthier meals.

          <h3>Foundational Research</h3>
          <h5>User Research</h5>
          <h6>Summary</h6>
          <p>
            We conducted surveys with potential users about their current
            lifestyles and how that affects the way they eat, as well as their
            thoughts on the nutritional values of their meals and how this could
            be improved. <br />Survey results revealed a range of pain points
            prospective users were currently facing in their current lifestyle.
          </p>
          <h6>Target Participant Characteristics</h6>

                Please describe your current schedule and how you incorporate
                meal planning and preparation into it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>How often do you cook home-made meals in a week?</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many days a week do you think you eat the required amount of
                fruit and vegetables?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do you believe you are eating enough healthy meals throughout

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">1</h6>
              <h6>Time</h6>
              Users often don’t have enough time to research, purchase
              ingredients, and then cook nutritional meals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">2</h6>
              <h6>Disorganization</h6>
              Often users will not have organized what they plan to cook in
              advance and will just cook something easy that is usually not
              nutritious.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">3</h6>
              <h6>Effort</h6>
              After working all day, users will often not want to put effort
              into cooking a meal, resulting in something quick such as a
              pre-made meal, or takeaway.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">4</h6>
              <h6>Knowledge</h6>
              Many users are not fully aware of the nutritional values of meals
              they are consuming, and there are still a few that are not sure
              what a nutritious meal should consist of.

          <p>
            Kelly is a busy intern who needs a way to plan quick, healthy meals
            so she can purchase ingredients in advance.
          </p>
          <h5>Hypothesis Statement</h5>
          <p>
            If Kelly uses ‘HealthEat’, then she will be able to plan meals from
            a selection of recipes and order the required ingredients in
            advance.
          </p>
          <h5>Goal Statement</h5>
          <p>
            Our mobile app/responsive website will let users plan nutritious
            meals which will affect busy young adults ensuring they have healthy
            home cooked meals throughout the week despite lack of time. <br />We
            will measure effectiveness by analyzing how many users use the
            planing feature of the app/website.

            To start the design of my website, I decided to start designing the
            mobile-website first, then translate my design to a desktop-website.
            This decision was made as ‘HealthEat’ key users are young adults,
            most of which use smart phones rather than computers to complete
            everyday task, and also keeping the Next Billion Users in mind.

              <p>
                The mobile website homepage is designed to be simple and to let
                users know about the main features of the website. Following
                similar designs as meal planning apps, i have included 3 lines
                to state the benefits of using this app, then included a
                carousel of featured recipes. I also included ‘how we work’
                steps to ensure users understand how to effectively use the
                website. I have also included a blog scroller below the fold as
                reading these posts is not what we want the user to notice first
                and foremost.

                The layout of the recipe page was organised so that users first

                actions for the user. Below these buttons is a short description
                of the recipe as well as a ‘nutritional information’ button.
                Next, the actual contents of the recipe are included with the
                ‘ingredients’ then the ‘method’. At the bottom of the page the
                ‘save recipe’ and ‘add to meal plan’ buttons are placed again so
                users don’t have to scroll back to the top to press these

            <p>
              For the mockup designs, the main colours I incorporated into the
              design is different shades of green, as it is associated with the
              environment and health. For the homepage I included 3 icons to aid
              in describing the 3 benefits of using ‘HealthEat’. I also used a
              very light shade of green to create containment of sections so
              that users can move between each section easily.
              <br />
              <br />
              On the desktop version of the website, following recommendations
              from user testing, a ‘my cart’ button has been added into the
              navigation bar so that users have easy access to complete one of
              the main purposes of the website.

              Throughout the website, the main call to action buttons had been
              changed to a background of dark green and a font of white with a
              shadow in order to be the most obvious to users so they know which
              buttons they need to press. Less important buttons were changed to
              a lighter variant of the dark green with black text so that they
              wouldn’t be as obvious on the page.
              <br />
              <br />
              Following some confusion about the saving/add to collection
              feature, I changed the ‘Save Recipe’ button to ‘Add to a
              Collection’ on the ‘Recipe Page’. I then included each of these
              collections at the top of the page on the ‘Recipe List Page’ so
              that users know which of their collections they’re looking at,
              rather than just the ‘Saved Recipes’ scroller I originally had.

            The cross-platform responsive website/mobile application is designed
            for young adults to learn how to cook healthier meals. Not only does
            this tool benefit ‘young adults’, but it can be used by a range of
            users to help with healthy eating and cooking. There are several
            unique features including adding recipes to collections, and adding
            ingredients to a shopping cart to order, as well as customizing your
            meal plans.

            Even after completing several rounds of testing, there’ll always be
            things i want to improve on and oftentimes products will not feel
            finished unless it has been developed by engineers and served up to
            the public. Even then, I’ll probably feel that that I can improve an
            app or website, especially as I develop as a UX designer, and learn
            new techniques.

            Thank you for taking the time to review my case study for
            ‘HEALTHEAT’.

            <br />
            this is the third and final project i have completed towards
            achieving my ux design certificate, and is the first time i have
            completed all steps of the design without guidance.

            <br />
            i would like to disclaim that this is not a real website, app or
            company. photos and icons used within the prototypes are not my own
            and have been credited to their respective authors/creators in my
            stickersheets in figma.
