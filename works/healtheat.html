          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <h5>The Product</h5>
          <p>
            ‘HealthEat’ is a responsive website and mobile application that
            allows users to meal plan and also order ingredients in advance to
            save time and money while also being healthier and more sustainable.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-end">Project Duration</h5>
          <p class="text-end">October 2023 - November 2023</p>
          <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <p>
            Young adults find it difficult to organise meals in advance, and
            also find time to shop for ingredients while being money and health
            concious.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-end">The Goal</h5>
          <p class="text-end">
            Design a cross platform tool to help young adults learn how to cook
            healthier meals.

          <h3>Foundational Research</h3>
          <h5>User Research</h5>
          <h6>Summary</h6>
          <p>
            We conducted surveys with potential users about their current
            lifestyles and how that affects the way they eat, as well as their
            thoughts on the nutritional values of their meals and how this could
            be improved. <br />Survey results revealed a range of pain points
            prospective users were currently facing in their current lifestyle.
          </p>
          <h6>Target Participant Characteristics</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>

          <h6>Survey Questions</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Please describe your current schedule and how you incorporate
                meal planning and preparation into it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>How often do you cook home-made meals in a week?</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                How many days a week do you think you eat the required amount of
                fruit and vegetables?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do you believe you are eating enough healthy meals throughout
                the week? Why or why not?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                How do you think you could be eating healthier meals throughout
                the week?

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">1</h6>
              <h6>Time</h6>
              Users often don’t have enough time to research, purchase
              ingredients, and then cook nutritional meals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">2</h6>
              <h6>Disorganization</h6>
              Often users will not have organized what they plan to cook in
              advance and will just cook something easy that is usually not
              nutritious.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">3</h6>
              <h6>Effort</h6>
              After working all day, users will often not want to put effort
              into cooking a meal, resulting in something quick such as a
              pre-made meal, or takeaway.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">4</h6>
              <h6>Knowledge</h6>
              Many users are not fully aware of the nutritional values of meals
              they are consuming, and there are still a few that are not sure
              what a nutritious meal should consist of.

          <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
          <p>
            Kelly is a busy intern who needs a way to plan quick, healthy meals
            so she can purchase ingredients in advance.
          </p>
          <h5>Hypothesis Statement</h5>
          <p>
            If Kelly uses ‘HealthEat’, then she will be able to plan meals from
            a selection of recipes and order the required ingredients in
            advance.
          </p>
          <h5>Goal Statement</h5>
          <p>
            Our mobile app/responsive website will let users plan nutritious
            meals which will affect busy young adults ensuring they have healthy
            home cooked meals throughout the week despite lack of time. <br />We
            will measure effectiveness by analyzing how many users use the
            planing feature of the app/website.

            To start the design of my website, I decided to start designing the
            mobile-website first, then translate my design to a desktop-website.
            This decision was made as ‘HealthEat’ key users are young adults,
            most of which use smart phones rather than computers to complete
            everyday task, and also keeping the Next Billion Users in mind.

              <h6>Homepage</h6>
              <p>
                The mobile website homepage is designed to be simple and to let
                users know about the main features of the website. Following
                similar designs as meal planning apps, i have included 3 lines
                to state the benefits of using this app, then included a
                carousel of featured recipes. I also included ‘how we work’
                steps to ensure users understand how to effectively use the
                website. I have also included a blog scroller below the fold as
                reading these posts is not what we want the user to notice first
                and foremost.

              <p>
                The layout of the recipe page was organised so that users first
                see the recipe title and an image of it with a ‘save recipe’ and
                ‘add to meal plan’ button directly below, indicating the main
                actions for the user. Below these buttons is a short description
                of the recipe as well as a ‘nutritional information’ button.
                Next, the actual contents of the recipe are included with the
                ‘ingredients’ then the ‘method’. At the bottom of the page the
                ‘save recipe’ and ‘add to meal plan’ buttons are placed again so
                users don’t have to scroll back to the top to press these
                buttons.

            <h6>Homepage</h6>
            <p>
              For the mockup designs, the main colours I incorporated into the
              design is different shades of green, as it is associated with the
              environment and health. For the homepage I included 3 icons to aid
              in describing the 3 benefits of using ‘HealthEat’. I also used a
              very light shade of green to create containment of sections so
              that users can move between each section easily.
              <br />
              On the desktop version of the website, following recommendations
              from user testing, a ‘my cart’ button has been added into the
              navigation bar so that users have easy access to complete one of
              the main purposes of the website.

               Originally the bouquet page was small with one picture, and
              you didn’t have to scroll. The page was made longer with more
              images and a ratings bar at the top as well as an ‘Add To
              Favourites button’ down the bottom. Furthermore the top and bottom
              menu and title bars were made to be kept on the top and bottom of
              the screen respectively while scrolling for easy access.

              An ‘Accessibility’ page was included for users to be able to set
              their desired font size, contrast, brightness, sound and
              vibration.

              The colours chosen for text have been tested and pass the WCAG AA
              standards, furthermore all key buttons have a black outline on the
              white background to enhance visibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6 class="number">3</h6>

              Icons as well as their respective texts have been included

              page they will navigate to.

              The top and bottom bars were designed so they remained at the top

              to the menu, cart, user page and back buttons.

                The app allows personalisations for users and allows them to
                quickly complete orders with saved information, as well as being
                accessible. “I really like all the information you can save in
                your account, it makes it really easy to re-order flowers.” -

              <p>
                I learned that it’s highly important to think about
                accessibility throughout the whole process, to ensure all users
                have equitable access to the app and different features it
                provides. If accessibility isn’t considered, the app then
                becomes unusable for a portion of the population.
